# selenium
This project isn't particularly useful, given that you could get the same data with an API call. However, you might be limited to the frequency of calls, or the total number of API calls you could make for free. I'm not planning to work on it anymore. I just wanted to try doing something with Selenium. The dependencies are: <b>Selenium, webdriver manager,</b> and <b>matplotlib</b>. It's set to use the Chrome webdriver and the webdriver manager should download the driver appropriate to the version of Chrome you have installed. `writefile.py` will create your csv. Enter the symbol you want to track. You can observe the current price in your terminal window, which will continuously update. Use `ctrl-z` to exit. Then, if you want, you can use `vis.py` for a graph.
